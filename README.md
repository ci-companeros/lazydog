*LazyDog* is a collaborative student resource-sharing platform, designed and built by four developers as part of a continued learning project following a bootcamp. The platform allows users to share, rate, and comment on educational resources related to various programming and development topics. Our goal is to create a space for students to access, contribute, and engage with high-quality learning materials while reinforcing what we've learned during the bootcamp.

## Agile Development Process

### Our Agile Approach

- The development of *LazyDog* is guided by Agile principles, emphasizing flexibility, continuous improvement, and rapid adaptation to change. While not strictly adhering to traditional Agile practices such as scheduled sprints or scrums, the development process is inspired by Agile methodologies.

<details>
<summary><b>Read more</b></summary>
<br>

- Instead of working within defined sprint timelines, the project focuses on milestones that align with the overall vision. This straightforward approach prioritizes the development of core functionalities first, allowing for a solid foundation before expanding into more complex features.

- Bugs and issues encountered during development are recorded as bug issues and added to the backlog. This strategy allows for continuous progress in other areas while ensuring that the backlog is revisited periodically. Prioritization is based on the severity and impact of the issues, maintaining development momentum while systematically addressing and resolving concerns.

- User feedback is actively sought and analyzed to identify areas for improvement, ensuring that LazyDog evolves to meet the needs and expectations of its users effectively.

### MoSCoW Prioritization

- To assist with task prioritization, labels have been added to user stories.
- The MoSCoW method involves categorizing tasks with the following labels:
  - **MUST HAVE**
  - **SHOULD HAVE**
  - **COULD HAVE**
  - **WON'T HAVE**
- This method helps ensure that essential features are completed first, optimizing resource allocation and effectively guiding the project's development priorities.

## Testing

Testing is integral to ensuring the application operates as intended. Comprehensive testing documentation, including strategies and results, is available in the [Testing Document.](documentation/testing/TESTING.md)

<details>
<summary><b>What we tested</b></summary>
<br>

- **Functionality**: Ensured that all featuresâ€”such as resource submissions, ratings, and commentsâ€”work as intended.
- **Usability**: Validated that users can navigate easily, interact with elements, and complete actions like signing up, logging in, submit and searching for resources.
- **Performance**: Checked the app's responsiveness, load times, and efficiency, especially on mobile devices.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>How we tested</b></summary>
<br>

- **Unit Testing**: Each component and function was tested individually to confirm that they perform correctly in isolation.
- **Manual Testing**: A hands-on approach was used to simulate real user interactions, validating the flow and behavior of the app in various scenarios.
- **Cross-Browser and Device Testing**: We ensured the platform works smoothly on different browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari) and across multiple screen sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop).
- **Code Validation**: The code was checked for errors, optimized, and debugged for performance improvements.
