# Resource Card Design

### Star Rating:

  - **Average Rating:** (e.g., “4.5 stars”).
  - **Number of Ratings:** (e.g., “(24 ratings)”).

- **Interactive Feedback:** After rating, a small confirmation (like a checkmark or "Rated" message) appears.

### Comments Display:

- **Comment Count:** A comment icon followed by the number of comments (e.g., “💬 15 comments”).
- **Clickable:** Clicking on the comment count takes the user to the detail page where they can read and leave comments.

  - **Title** and **Category** at the top.
  - **Tag icons** or labels below the title.

- **Middle Section:**
  - **Short Description** (around 2-3 lines).
