  <summary><b>Learning Objectives</b></summary>
  
  **Mastery of Full-Stack Development**:  
  Strengthen our skills in both frontend technologies like **React** and **Tailwind CSS**, and backend frameworks like **Django REST Framework**. Learn to seamlessly integrate client-side and server-side functionalities, ensuring a smooth and dynamic user experience. **Collaboration** will be key, as we share knowledge and troubleshoot issues that arise during development together.

  **API Design and Consumption**:  
  Gain expertise in designing and consuming APIs. Implement a robust backend API with Django REST Framework, and learn to consume it efficiently on the frontend, enabling dynamic content and user interactions. Through our collaboration, we will design API endpoints that meet the needs of our application.

  **Responsive and Accessible Web Design**:  
  Master responsive design principles with **Tailwind CSS**, ensuring the application provides a great user experience across devices, from desktops to mobile phones. Focus on web accessibility to make our app usable for all users. By working together, we can conduct usability tests and provide feedback to enhance the accessibility of our project.

  **Component-Based Architecture**:  
  Build a maintainable and scalable application by creating reusable React components. Learn how to effectively organize code to enhance readability and ensure smooth collaboration among our team members. Emphasizing teamwork will allow us to establish coding standards and best practices.

  **Agile Development and Project Management**:  
  Practice **Agile methodologies** and use tools like **Git** and **GitHub** for version control, collaboration, and task tracking. Learn to prioritize tasks using the **MoSCoW** method and continuously improve through user feedback and iterative development. Our teamwork will enhance our project management skills as we adapt and respond to changes collaboratively.

  **Security Best Practices**:  
  Focus on securing the application with features such as **user authentication**, **authorization**, and **input validation**. Learn how to handle **API keys** securely and implement safe coding practices to protect against common web vulnerabilities. We will collaborate to identify and address potential security risks.

  **Testing and Debugging**:  
  Implement both **manual and automated testing** to ensure our application is free from bugs. Learn to write unit tests, perform integration tests, and debug effectively during development, ensuring a high-quality product. Working as a team, we can conduct code reviews and pair programming sessions to enhance our testing strategies.

  **Cloud Deployment and Continuous Integration**:  
  Learn to deploy the application to cloud platforms like **Heroku** or **Netlify** for public access. Set up continuous integration pipelines to automatically test and deploy our code whenever changes are made. Collaborating as a team, we can manage deployment processes and troubleshoot any issues that arise.
