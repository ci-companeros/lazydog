   1. **ðŸŸ§ Orange = Sections**  
      * Large areas dividing the page into logical parts (e.g., header, footer, main content).

   2. **ðŸŸ© Green = Groups of elements**  
      * Collections of related modules or components, such as the category buttons or the list of resource cards.

   3. **ðŸŸª Purple = Modules (Self-contained units)**  
      * Complete components that combine several parts, such as a resource card or a widget. These function as cohesive, standalone units.

   4. **ðŸŸ¦ Blue = Parts of modules**  
      * The individual elements that make up a module, such as buttons, text, ratings, or links.

   5. **ðŸŸ¨ Yellow = Expandable areas**  
      * Dropdown menus and sections that can be shown/hidden based on user interaction.

   6. **ðŸŸ¥ Red = Dynamic content**  
      * Content that can update in real time (e.g., number of views, star ratings, user information).

## Communication Flow

* Data is fetched using custom hooks (e.g., `useFetchBookmarks`, `useFetchSubmissions`) and provided to the respective contexts.
* The `TabSection` manages the `selectedTab` state to show the appropriate section in `DashboardContentSection`.
* Child components of `DashboardContentSection` access and update their respective contexts.
* Actions (edit, delete) trigger API calls, updates to contexts, and re-renders.  Error handling is implemented within the custom hooks and potentially using error boundaries.

## Data Fetching and API Calls

Data fetching and API calls are handled within custom hooks:

* `useFetchBookmarks()`
* `useFetchSubmissions()`
* `useFetchComments()`
* `useFetchRatings()`
* `useFetchNotifications()`
* `useFetchSearchHistory()`
