# The 5 Planes of Web Development: A Blueprint for LazyDog

In the ever-evolving landscape of web development, a structured approach is essential for creating successful projects. This document outlines the **5 Planes of Web Development** as a comprehensive blueprint for LazyDog, a platform designed to streamline access to high-quality educational resources.

 Each planeâ€”**Strategy, Scope, Structure, Skeleton, and Surface**â€”provides a clear framework for understanding the rationale behind design decisions and technical implementations.

By following these principles, LazyDog aims to foster community engagement, enhance user experience, and facilitate learning for developers at different levels.

*Dive in to explore the details that shape our vision and execution!*

## Strategy (Why?)

*LazyDog* was built to address the challenge of finding high-quality, categorized educational resources in one place. It is aimed at students and developers looking to discover or contribute valuable content, with features that encourage community engagement through ratings and comments. The platform helps users enhance their learning journey and share insights from a range of development topics.

## Scope (What?)

This section outlines the core functionality of the platform, the features planned for the MVP (Minimum Viable Product), and the technologies used. The goal was to focus on essential features for resource submission, searchability, and community feedback while allowing for future scalability.

<a id="technology-stack"></a>
<details>
<summary><b>Technology Stack</b></summary>

- Frontend

  - **HTML/CSS/JavaScript**: Core technologies for building the structure, styling, and interactivity of the website.
  - **React.js**: A popular JavaScript library for building dynamic user interfaces, with components that manage state and handle complex UI interactions.
  - **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for building custom designs quickly with responsive design out of the box.

- Backend

  - **Node.js**: A JavaScript runtime used on the backend to handle requests and manage user authentication and resource submissions.
  - **Django REST Framework**: Used for creating RESTful APIs, allowing communication between the frontend and backend services.
  - **PostgreSQL**: A powerful open-source relational database used to store user accounts, submitted resources, ratings, and comments.

- OAuth

  - **OAuth**: A secure authentication method allowing users to log in using third-party providers such as Google, GitHub, etc.

- Hosting

  - **Frontend Hosting**: Vercel is used to host the React.js frontend, providing fast, global deployment and a seamless development workflow.
  - **Backend Hosting**: Free-tier hosting solutions (TO BE DECIDED) will be used to host the Node.js/Django backend and PostgreSQL database. ðŸš¨ <span style="color: red;">***OBS vilken hosting?***</span>

<details>
  <summary><strong>Prioritization of Features</strong></summary><br>

This section outlines the prioritization of features, identifying the essential ones for the initial launch (MVP - Minimum Viable Product) and which are reserved for future iterations. By prioritizing features based on their importance to both user experience and project goals, this breakdown ensures that the most critical functionality is delivered first, guiding development through an effective and incremental build process while managing expectations.
